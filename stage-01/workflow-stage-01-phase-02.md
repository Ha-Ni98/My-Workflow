# Stage 01: Phase 02 - Strategic Sprint Planning

You have successfully completed the analysis phase and generated a master action plan (`plan-stage-001.md`). The next step is to translate that high-level strategy into a concrete, step-by-step execution roadmap.

-----

### 🎯 Objective

To decompose the master action plan into a sequence of incremental, test-driven sprints. This phase creates the day-to-day playbook for developers, ensuring work is done in a logical order, priorities are clear, and progress is measurable.

-----

### 📁 Context & Inputs

For this phase, you will use the outputs from Phase 01:

  * **The Action Plan:** `/docs/plans/plan-stage-001.md`
  * **The Codebase Map:** `/docs/analysis/codebase-map.md`
  * **Global Rules:** `best-practices-security.mdc`, `ui-ux.mdc`, `architecture.mdc`
  * **Data Structure:** `database-schema.md`

-----

### 🪜 Steps

Your sole task is to generate a new, comprehensive sprint plan.

**1. Generate the Sprint Roadmap:**

  * **Create a new file:** `/docs/plans/sprints-stage-001.md`
  * **Analyze the Action Plan:** Thoroughly review `plan-stage-001.md`. Group related tasks from the "Critical Fixes," "Incomplete Features," and "Refactor Opportunities" sections into logical sprints.
  * **Prioritize Logically:** Structure the sprints to build the application from the ground up. The typical order should be:
    1.  Core setup, data layer, and authentication.
    2.  Backend API logic.
    3.  Core UI features that depend on the API.
    4.  UX improvements and polish.
  * **Define Each Sprint:** For every sprint, use the following markdown structure to define its scope and objectives clearly.

### 🔨 Sprint Structure

Use this template for every sprint inside `/docs/plans/sprints-stage-001.md`:

```markdown
### 🚀 Sprint [Number]: [Sprint Name]

**🎯 Goals:**
- [A clear, measurable outcome for what "done" looks like.]
- [Another key objective for this sprint.]

**📋 Tasks:**
- [ ] [Task 1: Describe the action. (#tag)]
- [ ] [Task 2: Describe the action. (#tag)]
- [ ] [Task 3: Describe the action. (#tag)]

**🧪 Testing & Validation:**
- [ ] `[🧪 TEST]` Describe a manual or automated test to verify a key outcome.
- [ ] `[🧪 TEST]` Describe another critical validation step.
- [ ] ✅ Address all linting and console errors within the scope of these changes.

**⚠️ Potential Risks:**
- [Note any existing features that could be broken by these changes.]
```

-----

### ✅ Expected Output

  * A single, detailed **`/docs/plans/sprints-stage-001.md`** file containing a full sequence of focused, well-defined sprints that guide the project from its current state to a refactored and feature-complete MVP.
