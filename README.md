# AI-Driven Full-Stack Development Workflow

This document outlines a comprehensive, three-stage workflow for building a full-stack application from an initial concept to a fully integrated product. Each phase includes a description and a ready-to-use prompt for an AI coding assistant like Cursor.

-----

## 🔨 Stage 00: Project-Specific Rule Generation

**Goal:** To establish a set of project-specific rules by analyzing the existing codebase's structure and technology stack. This creates a tailored foundation for all subsequent AI-driven development.

-----


## 🏛️ Stage 01: Foundational Refactor & Setup

**Goal:** To take an initial codebase, refactor it into a clean, scalable, and secure foundation, and establish the core project architecture.

-----

## ✨ Stage 02: Iterative Feature Implementation (Per-Page)

**Goal:** To build out the application's pages feature-by-feature using a functional front-end with type-safe mock data. This stage is a repeatable loop for each page.

-----

## 🔗 Stage 03: Back-End & Full-Stack Integration

**Goal:** To build the back-end API and services, then replace all front-end mock data with live API calls to create a fully operational application.
