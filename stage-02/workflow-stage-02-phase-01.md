# Stage 02: Phase 01 - Page Feature Analysis & Planning

This document outlines the first phase of the feature implementation stage. This process is repeated for **each new page**. The goal is to analyze a page's specific requirements and create a detailed, actionable plan for its implementation.

-----

### 🎯 Objective

To translate page-specific feature requirements, provided in a details document, into a clear and structured engineering plan. This plan will guide the creation of new components and the modification of existing ones, ensuring all new development aligns with the established architecture and project standards.

-----

### 📁 Context & Inputs

  * **Page Requirements:** A single markdown file describing the page's features (e.g., `/docs/pages/dashboard-details.md`).
  * **Codebase:** The current, refactored front-end project from Stage 01.
  * **Global Rules:** `best-practices-security.mdc`, `ui-ux.mdc`, `architecture.mdc`.
  * **Data Structure:** `database-schema.md` and the existing `/types` folder.

-----

### 🪜 Steps

#### Step 1: Requirement & Codebase Analysis

  * **Analyze Page Requirements:** Intelligently scan the provided page details file (e.g., `dashboard-details.md`). Extract all functional requirements, UI components, user interactions, and data dependencies described.
  * **Map to Existing Code:** Cross-reference the requirements with the existing codebase related to the giving page detailes. Identify which components can be reused, which need modification, and which must be created from scratch.

#### Step 2: Thematic Grouping

  * **Group by Features:** Consolidate the implementation tasks into logical groups based on the features described in the requirements document (e.g., `#user-profile-widget`, `#task-list`, `#data-visualization-chart`).
  * **Define Data Needs:** For each feature, explicitly define the mock data structures required. These structures **must** conform to the interfaces in the `/types` folder.

#### Step 3: Generate the Page Action Plan

  * **Create the Plan File:** Synthesize your analysis into a new, tactical markdown file. The filename must be specific to the page, for example: `/docs/plans/plan-stage-02-page-dashboard.md`.
  * **Structure the Plan:** Use the following sections to detail the implementation strategy for the page.
    1.  **🧩 New Components to Create:** List each new component, its purpose, props, and location.
    2.  **🔧 Existing Components to Modify:** Detail the required changes to any existing components.
    3.  **💾 Data & State Requirements:** Describe the required mock data and any new client-side state management logic (e.g., hooks, context).
    4.  **🔄 User Interaction Flows:** Outline the step-by-step user interactions and the expected UI responses.
    5.  **✅ Acceptance Criteria:** A checklist of what defines a "complete" implementation for this page, derived from the requirements.

-----

### ✅ Expected Outputs

  * A detailed, page-specific action plan (e.g., **`/docs/plans/plan-stage-02-page-dashboard.md`**).
  * A list of any ambiguities in the page requirements that need clarification.
