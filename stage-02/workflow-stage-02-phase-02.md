# Stage 02: Phase 02 - Page-Specific Sprint Planning

With a detailed action plan for the page created, the next step is to break down the work into a concrete, step-by-step sprint roadmap.

-----

### 🎯 Objective

To decompose the page-specific action plan into a sequence of incremental, test-driven sprints. This creates a clear, day-to-day playbook for implementing the page's features.

-----

### 📁 Context & Inputs

  * **The Page Action Plan:** The output from the previous phase (e.g., `/docs/plans/plan-stage-02-page-dashboard.md`).
  * **Global Rules & Data Structure:** All relevant `.mdc` and `.md` files.

-----

### 🪜 Steps

Your sole task is to generate a new, comprehensive sprint plan for the page.

  * **Create the Sprint File:** Create a new file named after the page plan, e.g., `/docs/plans/sprints-stage-02-page-dashboard.md`.
  * **Analyze the Action Plan:** Thoroughly review the page action plan. Group related tasks from the "New Components," "Modifications," and "Data Requirements" sections into logical sprints.
  * **Prioritize Logically:** Structure the sprints to build the page's features in a sensible order (e.g., data structures first, then components, then interactions).
  * **Define Each Sprint:** For every sprint, use the standard markdown structure to define its scope and objectives clearly.

### 🔨 Sprint Structure

Use this template for every sprint inside the page's sprint file:

```markdown
### 🚀 Sprint [Number]: [Sprint Name]

**🎯 Goals:**
- [A clear, measurable outcome for what "done" looks like.]

**📋 Tasks:**
- [ ] [Task 1: Describe the action. (#tag)]
- [ ] [Task 2: Describe the action. (#tag)]

**🧪 Testing & Validation:**
- [ ] `[🧪 TEST]` Describe a test to verify a key UI element or interaction.
- [ ] ✅ Address all linting and console errors within the scope of these changes.

**⚠️ Potential Risks:**
- [Note any existing features that could be affected by these changes.]
```

-----

### ✅ Expected Output

  * A single, detailed sprint plan file (e.g., **`/docs/plans/sprints-stage-02-page-dashboard.md`**) containing a full sequence of sprints to implement all features for the specified page.
