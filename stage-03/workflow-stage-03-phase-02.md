# Stage 03: Phase 02 - Integration Sprint Planning

With the master plan for back-end construction and front-end integration defined, this phase breaks that plan down into a logical sequence of manageable sprints.

-----

### 🎯 Objective

To decompose the integration action plan into a sequence of incremental, test-driven sprints. This creates a clear roadmap for building the back-end first, then connecting the front-end to it feature by feature.

-----

### 📁 Context & Inputs

  * **The Integration Action Plan:** `/docs/plans/plan-stage-03-integration.md`.
  * **Global Rules & Data Structure:** All relevant `.mdc` and `.md` files.

-----

### 🪜 Steps

Your sole task is to generate a new, comprehensive sprint plan for the full-stack integration.

  * **Create the Sprint File:** Create a new file: `/docs/plans/sprints-stage-03-integration.md`.
  * **Analyze the Action Plan:** Thoroughly review `plan-stage-03-integration.md`.
  * **Prioritize Logically:** Structure the sprints to ensure a stable build process. The recommended order is:
    1.  **Back-End Sprints:** Create a series of sprints to build out the API, model by model (e.g., "Sprint 1: User Model & Auth API", "Sprint 2: Task Model CRUD API").
    2.  **Front-End Integration Sprints:** After the relevant back-end is complete, create sprints to replace mock data on the front-end, page by page (e.g., "Sprint 3: Integrate Dashboard with Live Task Data").
  * **Define Each Sprint:** For every sprint, use the standard markdown structure to define its scope and objectives.

### 🔨 Sprint Structure

Use this template for every sprint inside the integration sprint file:

```markdown
### 🚀 Sprint [Number]: [Sprint Name]

**🎯 Goals:**
- [A clear, measurable outcome for what "done" looks like.]

**📋 Tasks:**
- [ ] [Task 1: Build GET /api/users endpoint. (#api, #backend)]
- [ ] [Task 2: Remove mock user data from ProfilePage.tsx. (#ui, #frontend)]

**🧪 Testing & Validation:**
- [ ] `[🧪 TEST]` Verify API endpoint with an API client.
- [ ] `[🧪 TEST]` Confirm front-end component correctly displays data from the API.
- [ ] ✅ Address all linting and console errors.
```

### ✅ Expected Output

  * A single, detailed sprint plan file: **`/docs/plans/sprints-stage-03-integration.md`**.
